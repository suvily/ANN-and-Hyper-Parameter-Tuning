# ANN-and-Hyper-Parameter-Tuning
Objectives:

__Prepare a model which can classify it with f1 score = 70% and accuracy = 75%.

__Use neural networks combined with any HP parameter tuning.

__You can make use of any preprocessing activities if needed.

__No external data shall be added for increasing evaluation metric values.
